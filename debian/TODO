libgphoto2 (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Poke upstream to get copyright and license statements clarified.
  * Ask whether 9e8a0e9a1e is correct:
      “No longer ship an empty /usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop directory.”
  * Check the impact of 52da07b9a2 on reverse dependencies:
      “Drop “*.la” files from the -dev package.”
  * Adjust the Depends: according to the content of the “*.pc” files.
  * Write manpages for the following Perl scripts, and submit them
    upstream for inclusion:
     - /usr/bin/gphoto2-config (source: gphoto2-config.in)
     - /usr/bin/gphoto2-port-config (source: libgphoto2_port/gphoto2-port-config.in)
  * Are those scripts really needed anyway? A call to pkg-config would
    do the job.
  * Check the impact of e496e063f3 on reverse dependencies, and
    forward that upstream:
      “Drop the recursive symlink (“/usr/include/gphoto2/gphoto2 -> .”).”
  * Check the target relationships towards patch-related timestamps.
